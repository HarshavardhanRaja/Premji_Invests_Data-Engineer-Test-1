The assignment is to create 2 pipelines, one with automated scrapping based on ticker in instructions, second one based on static input .
* Create pipeline with Airflow



* Pipelines:
    * Pipeline 1:
                * Data Sources: (search for only two keywords: HDFC, Tata Motors, fetch 5 latest articles for each ticker)
    * Data Source1: https://yourstory.com

                    * Data Source2: https://finshots.in/



              * schedule: 7pm every working day

              * Steps:

                             * Fetch data (text data of article) from Data Source1, Data Source2

                             * Do basic cleaning and processing (prepping/deduplication on title/text data for that ticker) on the data

                             * Generate sentiment score for the company (assume a mock/dummy API which can be called for it with input as news text and response as float between 0 to 1)

                             * Persist final score in some DB, Data Lake or anything of your choice, and anything else you may consider necessary (with justification)
